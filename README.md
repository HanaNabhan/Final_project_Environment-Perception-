#Environment Perception for Self-Driving Cars

This repository contains the final project for a course on self-driving car systems. The project implements an environment perception pipeline for autonomous vehicles, focusing on lane detection, object recognition, and control mechanisms.

##Features

###Lane Detection: Tracks road lanes for navigation.

###Object Detection: Recognizes objects like humans, vehicles, and cones using YOLOv7.

###Sensor Fusion: Combines odometry, LiDAR, and camera inputs with Kalman filtering.


##Requirements

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

ROS (Robot Operating System)
