# Environment Perception for Self-Driving Cars

This repository contains the final project for a course on self-driving car systems. The project implements an environment perception pipeline for autonomous vehicles, focusing on lane detection, object recognition, and control mechanisms.

## Features

### Lane Detection: Tracks road lanes .

### Object Detection: Recognizes vehicles.

### Sensor Fusion: Combines camera inputs with Kalman filtering.


## Requirements

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

ROS (Robot Operating System)
